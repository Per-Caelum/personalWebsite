A template for what the main will likely become.
Currently in WIP.

The landing page should lead to index.html and that page should be able to link to the other files. Other pages should be accessible at the top of the page in the nav bar.

Javascript functionality will just have an on-load alert for Hello world and a button in the footer to also alert for Hello world, but also change the text in the footer as well.
